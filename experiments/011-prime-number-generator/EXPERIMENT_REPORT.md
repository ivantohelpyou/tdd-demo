## Timing Methodology

**Innovation**: This experiment used file creation timestamps to calculate actual development times rather than manual timing:

- **Start Time**: First file created across all methods (21:04:07)
- **End Time**: Last file created in each method directory
- **Accuracy**: Precise to the second without manual intervention
- **Verification**: `find [method-dir] -type f -exec stat -c "%y %n" {} \; | sort | tail -1`

This timestamp-based approach eliminates timing measurement overhead and provides objective, reproducible timing data for all future experiments.
